# Virtual_hand_mouse_opencv_project
Computer vision is great part of Artificial intelligence It can do wonderfull things beyond one's imagination.

In this i have tried to make a virtual mouse using opencv and python. By this one can hover over the screen and click without even touching the mouse or touchpad. :)

I like to thank murtaza workshop for guiadance.
